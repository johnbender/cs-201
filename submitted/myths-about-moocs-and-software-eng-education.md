# David Paterson, Myths about MOOCs and Software Engineering Education

Distinguished Professor David Paterson presented a talk on MOOCs (Massively Open Online Course) and how they are impacting teaching at the University of California Berkley.

He began his talk by laying out a series of myths associated with software engineering. Initially he discussed how the current approach to teaching software engineering at the university level is ineffective due to a lack of time alotted and a lack of interest on the part of faculty. He went on to point out that the skills most valued by companies in industry, teamwork and legacy code support, are rarely addressed.

He continued by discussing the new approach they've taken at UC Berkeley that began by consulting industry for their input on the skills they most needed. After significant consideration the new classes have been reformulated to include teaching about agile team practices, more advanced tooling, and current trends in cloud computing. The goal is to give students relevant skills and knowledge while covering the important basics of running a software project.

Dr. Paterson went on to address the value of the agile approach in industry based on the data they were able to collect. For smaller projects (<= $1mm) agile had a significantly higher success rate that larger projects (>= $10mm) built using traditional waterfall methods. The general implication was that, to build large pieces of software, the problem must be decomposed but it's not yet clear that this will work for all cases or how it might work.

He concluded his talk with a discussion on MOOCs, some myths around them, and how they've made software engineering teaching at Berkeley better. He emphasized that MOOCs are unlikely to replace traditional teaching methods at least in the short term because the level of motivation required to attend and complete the course is high. In addition, statistics show that most of the attendees are college educated already. Generally the statistics and feedback garnered through putting the course on EdEx have made the course much better for Berkeley students according to the professor.
