# Professor leonidias guibas - The Functorality of Data -- Understanding Geometric Data Sets Jointly

- networks of images/shapes
 - many things in them other than computers
 - interested in the relationships between things in network
 - same and different

- books
 - linear operators
 - homological algebra
  - functors and categories
  - commutative diagrams
 - plato's republic
  - allegory of cave
   - shadows
   - only knowing the shadows
 - invisible cities

- structure of geometric data
 - gps traces
 - images
  - foreground/background
 - 3d scans
  - windows etc
 - time series
 - microarray

- structures across data
 - images taken from different places of same object (related)

- each data set is not isolated
 - all data can be improved if considered with other data
 - segmentation of the human body
  - hard to get neck
  - use information from other animals
  - correspondence between necks

- more data makes data interconnected
 - objects are naturally organized into classes

- societies or social networks of data sets
 - network itself is exploitable
 - validating operations by validating across data sets
 - network is great regularizer in join data analysis

- joint data analysis is considering many different data sets for a single data set

- semantic structure
 - find a city map in gps traces
 - relations as collections of correspondences or maps
  - multiscale mappings
  - point level
  - part level

- relationships are first class things
 - mappings between data sets or the objects under consideration

- value in being able to transport intuition between models
 - horses to camels
 - people/animals in different modes/positions
 - images placed on maps

- functions on data
 - map functions and not objects
 - operators that map functions to functions
  - functors?

- challenges
 - comparing everything to everything and itself
 - build relational networks between data
 - learning how humans relate seemingly abstract things for a task
 - assign importance to relationships

- functional maps
 - two objects that are the same and assign correspondence between parts

- starting from a regular map
 - lion and cat
  - find basic starting point
  - transfer attributes just by x position
  - pointwise functor over a cow and create inverse
 - key to map functions

- function maps are more general than point maps for things like symetry
- map composition can be represented in some cases with matrix multiplication
- linear algebra can be brought to bear by reducing to linear equations in many cases
- map estimation possible

- finding issues with maps
- measure distortions
- functional inner product
- key observation
 - linear products determine range (quad)

- functional map
 - output: shape diff

- compare humans
- composing comparisons allows progression toward complex changes

- comparison of horse running and mapping of positions etc

- localized comparisons
 - ask about subset of data
 - how does it apply to different data parts

- can compare difference
- sometimes differences are more important that similarity
- maps vs differences and similarities
- the information is in the maps

- additions to algebric topology functors
- this has stats and the map has to be estimated
- linear relationships abound

- similar objects from different views
 - how do the images help to find other images
 - small dense graphs
 - large spare graphs
 - superpixel decomposition
 - functions over these graphs
 - cow/car functions arise
  - turn images into silhouette
 - functions to refine maps

- they have derived plato's shadows
- that is they derived the essence of cow in terms of vector spaces
- colimit of vector spaces of cows finds the cowlike attributes in the same way that it would find the similarity with tables (four legs)

- invisible cities concludes with telling kublai kahn that all the cities are similar to venice
- in the same way they are finding the similarity in images other objects

- mooc homework autograding
